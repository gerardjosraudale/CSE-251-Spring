'''
Requirements:
1. Write a function that takes a number and computes the product of all numbers between
   one and that number (exclusive). This will be the target of your thread.
2. Create a thread to run this function.
3. Assert that your products are correct for the given number.
4. COMMENT every line that you write yourself.
   
Things to consider:
a. What is the correct syntax for creating a thread with one argument?
   (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3221655/python-threading-string-arguments)
b. How do you start a thread? (see this week's reading) 
c. How will you wait until the thread is done? (see this week's reading)
d. Do threads (including the main thread) share global variables? (see https://superfastpython.com/thread-share-variables/)
e. How will you ensure that one thread doesn't change the value of
   your global while another thread is using it too? (We haven't learned about locks yet, so you
   won't be able to run your threads simultaneously)
f. How do you modify the value of a global variable (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10588317/python-function-global-variables)
