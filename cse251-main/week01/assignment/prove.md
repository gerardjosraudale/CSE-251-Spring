Assignments are individual and not team based.  Any assignments found to be plagiarized will be graded according to the `ACADEMIC HONESTY` section in the syllabus. Personalize your code by adding comments explaining how your code works. This provides evidence that you wrote it yourself. You are allowed to work with other students, but your comments need to be in your own words.
