# 02 Prove: Creating Threads 

## Overview

Your task is to create two programs that will compute the product of numbers from 1 to a given number (not counting the final number). The first program will need to perform this function using the threading module and global variable. The second program will perform this function by extending the Thread class and creating an object using this thread class.

Assignments are not accepted late. Instead, you should submit what you have completed by the due date for partial credit.

Assignments are individual and not team based.  Any assignments found to be plagiarized will be graded according to the `ACADEMIC HONESTY` section in the syllabus. Personalize your code by adding comments explaining how your code works. This provides evidence that you wrote it yourself. You are allowed to work with other students, but your comments need to be in your own words.

## Submission

When finished

- upload your assignment_a.py and signature files to Canvas.
- upload your assignment_b.py and signature files to Canvas.
