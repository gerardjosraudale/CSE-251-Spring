'''
Requirements
1. Using two threads, put space ships onto a shared queue, with one thread consuming
   the items from the queue and the other producing the items.
2. The size of queue should never exceed 10.
3. Do not call queue size to determine if maximum size has been reached. This means
   that you should not do something like this: 
        if q.size() < 10:
   Use the blocking semaphore function 'acquire'.
4. Produce a Plot of count vs queue size (okay to use q.size since this is not a
   condition statement).
5. COMMENT every line that you write yourself.
   
Questions:
1. Do you need to use locks around accessing the queue object when using multiple threads? 
   Why or why not?

   >
2. How would you define a semaphore in your own words?

   >
3. Read https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2407589/what-does-the-term-blocking-mean-in-programming.
   What does it mean that the "join" function is a blocking function? Why do we want to block?
